# Hangman-blud

# Game made with pycharm and honestly took me a week because I lacked the motivation to finish it even though the total time I spent making it was under 2hr. Nothing wrong with the game but I just feel that I wasn't that interested in it and I want to move onto projects where I'll have greater interest.
